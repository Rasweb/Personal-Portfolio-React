          I have been an front end developer intern at Nexus Group, from the 3rd
          of October to the 9th of december. When I was there me and another
          employee created/revived a six year old webGui. Using JavaScript,
          HTML, CSS and Vue, we updated old package and created functionality to
          create, update, revoke and list different certificates.
